1. Incentive structure for the submission and validation of headers (consensus state updates), as opposed to user transactions
    1. What is intended here?
    1. Does it make sense to have multiple clients from one chain to another?
        1. May make sense to have multiple client for different threshold confirmations on Nakamoto Consensus algorithms
        1. Otherwise you only need to store headers once so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    1. Does it make sense to have multiple connections from one chain to another?
    1. Can connections be rivalrous? Parties A and B keep headers updated for an IBC connection, and are able to charge transaction fees exclusively for use of that connection. Or are connections necessarily open for everyone to update headers.
1. How will new validity predicates be put into the Cosmos Hub?
    1. Chains will different consensus algorithms will presumably need new validity predicates
    1. Does the addition of a new validity predicate require a governance vote?
1. What is the data confidentiality ability in IBC? Taken from the specification:
    1. Data confidentiality is the ability of the host state machine to refuse to make particular data available to particular parties without impairing the functionality of the IBC protocol.
1. What is this exactly?
    1. Explanation of the concepts of Provable Store and Private Stores. What’s the difference between the store?
