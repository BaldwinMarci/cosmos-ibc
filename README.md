# Interchain Standards Development

## Synopsis

This repository is the canonical location for development and documentation of inter-chain standards utilized by the Cosmos network & interchain ecosystem. Initially it will be used to consolidate design documentation for the inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC), encoding standards for Cosmos chains, and miscellaneous utilities such as off-chain message signing.

## Standardization

Please see [ICS 1](spec/ics-1-ics-standard) for a description of what a standard entails.

To propose a new standard, [open an issue](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/issues/new). To start a new standardization document, copy the [template](spec/ics-template.md) and open a PR.

See [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md) for a description of the standardization process.

## Interchain Standards

All standards in the "draft" stage are listed here in order of their ICS numbers, sorted by category.

If you're interested in an architectural overview of IBC (the subject of most of the initial interchain standards), see [here](./docs/IBC_ARCHITECTURE.md).

Check [issue 26](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/issues/26) for a list of IBC specifications in progress.
