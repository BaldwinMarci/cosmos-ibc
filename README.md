# Interchain Standards Development

## Synopsis

This repository is the canonical location for development and documentation of inter-chain standards utilized by the Cosmos network & interchain ecosystem. Initially it will be used to consolidate design documentation for the inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC), encoding standards for Cosmos chains, and miscellaneous utilities such as off-chain message signing.

## Standardization

Please see [ICS 1](spec/ics-1-ics-standard) for a description of what a standard entails.

To propose a new standard, [open an issue](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/issues/new). To start a new standardization document, copy the [template](spec/ics-template.md) and open a PR.

See [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md) for a description of the standardization process.

## IBC Quick References

The subject of most initial interchain standards is the inter-blockchain communication protocol, "IBC".

If you are diving in or planning to review specifications, the following are recommended reading:
- [IBC Architecture](./docs/ibc/1_IBC_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [IBC Design Principles](./docs/ibc/2_IBC_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md)
- [IBC Terminology](./docs/ibc/3_IBC_TERMINOLOGY.md)
- [IBC Usecases](./docs/ibc/4_IBC_USECASES.md)
- [IBC specification progress tracking](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/issues/26)

## Interchain Standards

All standards in the "draft" stage are listed here in order of their ICS numbers, sorted by category.
