# Roadmap IBC specs

_Lastest update: February 11th, 2022_

This document endeavours to inform the wider IBC community about plans and priorities for the specification work of IBC. This roadmap should be read as a high-level guide, rather than a commitment to schedules and deliverables. The degree of specificity is inversely proportional to the timeline. We will update this document periodically to reflect the status and plans.
 
This roadmap reflects the major activities that the [standards committee](STANDARDS_COMMITTEE.md) is engaged with in the coming quarters. It is, by no means, a thorough reflection of all the specification work that is happening in the broad ecosystem, as many other parties work as well in specs that eventually end up in this repository.

## Q1 - 2022

- Update the Interchain Accounts ([ICS27](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/master/spec/app/ics-027-interchain-accounts/README.md)) and Relayer Incentivisation ([ICS29](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/master/spec/app/ics-029-fee-payment)) specifications to align them with the ibc-go implementation.
- Work on the connection upgradability and channel upgredability specs.
- Work on spec for ordered channels that are allowed to timeout.
- Work on spec to allow timeouts on ordered channels that don't have proof of absence.
- Review [IRISnet](https://www.irisnet.org)'s [ICS721](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/pull/615) specification proposal for NFT transfers.
