# Micro IBC Architecture

### Context

The implementation of the entire IBC protocol as it currently stands is a large undertaking. While there exists ready-made implementations like ibc-go this is only deployable on the Cosmos-SDK. Similarly, there exists ibc-rs which is a library for chains to integrate. However, this requires the chain to be implemented in Rust, there still exists some non-trivial work to integrate the ibc-rs library into the target state machine, and certain limitations either in the state machine or in ibc-rs may prevent using the library for the target chain.

Writing an implementation from scratch is a problem many ecosystems face as a major barrier for IBC adoption.

The goal of this document is to serve as a "micro-IBC" specification that will allow new ecosystems to implement a protocol that can communicate with fully implemented IBC chains using the same security assumptions.

The micro-IBC protocol must have the same security properties as IBC, and must be completely compatible with IBC applications. It may not have the full flexibility offered by standard IBC.

### Desired Properties

- Light-client backed security
- Unique identifiers for each channel end
- Authenticated application channel (must verify that the counterparty is running the correct client and app parameters)
- Applications must be mutually compatible with standard IBC applications.
- Must be capable of being implemented in smart contract environments with resource constraints and high gas costs.

### Specification

### Light Clients

The light client module can be implemented exactly as-is with regards to its functionality. It **must** have external endpoints for relayers (off-chain processes that have full-node access to other chains in the network) to initialize a client, update the client, and submit misbehaviour in case the trust model of the client is violated by the counterparty consensus mechanism (e.g. committing to different headers for the same height).

The implementation of each of these endpoints will be specific to the particular consensus mechanism targetted. The choice of consensus algorithm itself is arbitrary, it may be a Proof-of-Stake algorithm like CometBFT, or a multisig of trusted authorities, or a rollup that relies on an additional underlying client in order to verify its consensus.

Thus, the endpoints themselves should accept arbitrary bytes for the arguments passed into these client endpoints as it is up to each individual client implementation to unmarshal these bytes into the structures they expect.

```typescript
// initializes client with a starting client state containing all light client parameters
// and an initial consensus state that will act as a trusted seed from which to verify future headers
function createClient(
    clientState: bytes,
    consensusState: bytes,
): (Identifier, error)

// once a client has been created, it can be referenced with the identifier and passed the header
// to keep the client up-to-date. In most cases, this will cause a new consensus state derived from the header
// to be stored in the client
function updateClient(
    clientId: Identifier,
    header: bytes,
): error

// once a client has been created, relayers can submit misbehaviour that proves the counterparty chain
// The light client must verify the misbehaviour using the trust model of the consensus mechanism
// and execute some custom logic such as freezing the client from accepting future updates and proof verification.
function submitMisbehaviour(
    clientId: Identifier,
    misbehaviour: bytes,
): error
```
