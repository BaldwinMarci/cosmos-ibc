## Placing CCV within an ABCI Application
[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

Before describing the data structures and sub-protocols of the CCV protocol, we provide a short overview of the interfaces the CCV module implements and the interactions with the other ABCI application modules.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Implemented Interfaces

- CCV is an **ABCI application module**, which means it MUST implement the logic to handle some of the messages received from the consensus engine via ABCI, e.g., `InitChain`, `EndBlock` 
  (for more details, take a look at the [ABCI documentation](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/spec/abci/abci.html)). 
  In this specification we define the following methods that handle messages that are of particular interest to the CCV protocol:
  - `InitGenesis()` -- Called when the chain is first started, on receiving an `InitChain` message from the consensus engine. 
  - `EndBlock()` -- Contains logic that is automatically triggered at the end of each block. 
    This is also where the module can inform the underlying consensus engine of changes in the validator set.

> TODO: `ExportGenesis()` and handling hard forks. 

- CCV is an **IBC module**, which means it MUST implement the module callbacks interface defined in [ICS 26](../../core/ics-026-routing-module/README.md#module-callback-interface). The interface consists of a set of callbacks for 
  - channel opening handshake, which we describe in the [Initialization](#initialization) section;
  - channel closing handshake, which we describe in the [Channel Closing Handshake](#channel-closing-handshake) section;
  - and packet relay, which we describe in the [Packet Relay](#packet-relay) section.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Interfacing Other Modules

- As an ABCI application module, the CCV module interacts with the underlying consensus engine through ABCI:
  - On the provider chain,
    - it initializes the application (e.g., binds to the expected IBC port) in the `InitGenesis()` method.
  - On the consumer chain,
    - it initializes the application (e.g., binds to the expected IBC port, creates a client of the provider chain) in the `InitGenesis()` method;
    - it provides the validator updates in the `EndBlock()` method.

- As an IBC module, the CCV module interacts with Core IBC for functionalities regarding
  - port allocation ([ICS 5](../../core/ics-005-port-allocation)) via `portKeeper`;
  - channels and packet semantics ([ICS 4](../../core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics)) via `channelKeeper`;
  - connection semantics ([ICS 3](../../core/ics-003-connection-semantics)) via `connectionKeeper`;
  - client semantics ([ICS 2](../../core/ics-002-client-semantics)) via `clientKeeper`.

- For the [Initialization sub-protocol](#initialization), the provider CCV module interacts with a Governance module by handling governance proposals to spawn new consumer chains. 
  If such proposals pass, then all validators on the provider chain MUST validate the consumer chain at spawn time; 
  otherwise they get slashed. 
  For an example of how governance proposals work, take a look at the [Governance module documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/gov/) of Cosmos SDK. 

- For the [Validator Set Update sub-protocol](#validator-set-update), the provider CCV module interacts with a Staking module on the provider chain. 
  For an example of how staking works, take a look at the [Staking module documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/staking/) of Cosmos SDK. 
  The interaction is defined by the following interface:
  ```typescript 
  interface StakingKeeper {
    // get UnbondingPeriod from the provider Staking module 
    UnbondingTime(): Duration

    // get validator updates from the provider Staking module
    GetValidatorUpdates(chainID: string): [ValidatorUpdate]

    // notify the provider Staking module of matured CCV unbonding operations
    UnbondValidators(chainID: string, valUpdates [ValidatorUpdate])
  }
  ```

## Data Structures

### External Data Structures
[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

This section describes external data structures used by the CCV module.

The CCV module uses the ABCI `ValidatorUpdate` data structure, which consists of a validator address (i.e., the hash of its public key) and its power, i.e.,
```typescript
interface ValidatorUpdate {
  address: string
  power: int64
}
```
The provider chain sends to the consumer chain a list of `ValidatorUpdate`s, containing an entry for every validator that had its power updated. 

The data structures required for creating clients (i.e., `ClientState`, `ConsensusState`) are defined in [ICS 2](../../core/ics-002-client-semantics). 
Specifically for Tendermint clients, the data structures are defined in [ICS 7](../../client/ics-007-tendermint-client).

### CCV Data Structures
[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

The CCV channel state is indicated by `ChannelStatus`, which is defined as 
```typescript
enum ChannelStatus {
  UNINITIALIZED   // default state
  INITIALIZING    // the channel is in handshake process
  VALIDATING      // the channel is open and validating
  INVALID         // the channel is invalid and can no longer process packets
}
```

The CCV module is initialized through the `InitGenesis` method when the chain is first started. The initialization is done from a genesis state. This is the case for both provider and consumer chains:
- On the provider chain, the genesis state is described by the following interface:
  ```typescript
  interface ProviderGenesisState {
    // a list of existing consumer chains
    consumerStates: [ConsumerState]
  }
  ```
  with `ConsumerState` defined as
  ```typescript
  interface ConsumerState {
    chainId: string
    channelId: Identifier
    status: ChannelStatus
  }
  ```
- On the consumer chain, the genesis state is described by the following interface:
  ```typescript
  interface ConsumerGenesisState {
    providerClientState: ClientState
    providerConsensusState: ConsensusState
  }
  ```

The provider CCV module handles governance proposals to spawn new consumer chains. The structure of these proposals is defined by the `Proposal` interface in the [Governance module documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/gov/). The content of these proposals is described by the following interface (we omit typical fields such as title and description):
  ```typescript
  interface CreateConsumerChainProposal {
    // The proposed chain ID of the new consumer chain.
    // Must be different from all other consumer chain IDs 
    // of the executing proposer chain.
    chainId: string

    // The proposed initial height of new consumer chain.
    // For a completely new chain, this will be {0,1}; 
    // however, it may be different if this is a chain 
    // that is converting to a consumer chain.
    initialHeight: Height

    // Spawn time is the time on the provider chain at which 
    // the consumer chain genesis is finalized and all validators
    // will be responsible for starting their consumer chain 
    // validator node.
    spawnTime: Timestamp

    // the hash of the genesis state for the consumer chain
    genesisHash: [byte]
  }
  ```
  Note that `Height` is defined in [ICS 7](../../client/ics-007-tendermint-client).

### CCV Packets
[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

The structure of the packets sent through the CCV channel is defined by the `Packet` interface in [ICS 4](../../core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics). Packets are acknowledged by the remote side by sending back an `Acknowledgement` that contains either a result, created with `NewResultAcknowledgement()`, or an error, created with `NewErrorAcknowledgement()`. 

The following packet data types are required by the CCV module:
- `VSCPacketData` contains a list of validator updates, i.e., 
    ```typescript
    interface VSCPacketData {
      updates: [ValidatorUpdate]
    }
    ```
> Note that for brevity we use e.g., `VSCPacket` to refer to a packet with `VSCPacketData` as its data.

### CCV State
[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

This section describes the internal state of the CCV module. For simplicity, the state is described by a set of variables; for each variable, both the type and a brief description is provided. In practice, all the state (except for hardcoded constants, e.g., `ProviderPortId`) is stored in a key/value store (KVS). The host state machine provides a KVS interface with three functions, i.e., `get()`, `set()`, and `delete()` (as defined in [ICS 24](../../core/ics-024-host-requirements)).

- `[ValidatorUpdate]` is a list of `ValidatorUpdate`s. It exposes the following interface:
  ```typescript
  interface [ValidatorUpdate] {
    // append updates to the list;
    // the list is modified
    Append(updates: [ValidatorUpdate]) 

    // return an aggregated list of updates, i.e., 
    // keep only the latest update per validator;
    // the original list is not modified
    Aggregate(): [ValidatorUpdate]

    // remove all the updates from the list;
    // the list is modified
    RemoveAll()
  }

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### State on the provider chain

- `ProviderPortId = "provider"` is the port ID the provider CCV module is expected to bind to.
- `pendingClient: Map<(Timestamp, string), Height>` is a mapping from `(timestamp, chainId)` tuples to the initial height of pending clients, i.e., belonging to consumer chains that were not yet spawned, but for which a `CreateConsumerChainProposal` was received.
- `chainToClient: Map<string, Identifier>` is a mapping from consumer chain IDs to the associated client IDs.
- `chainToChannel: Map<string, Identifier>` is a mapping from consumer chain IDs to the CCV channel IDs.
- `channelToChain: Map<Identifier, string>` is a mapping from CCV channel IDs to consumer chain IDs.
- `channelStatus: Map<Identifier, ChannelStatus>` is a mapping from CCV channel IDs to CCV channel state, as indicated by `ChannelStatus`.
- `pendingUpdates: Map<string, [ValidatorUpdate]>` is a mapping from consumer chain IDs to a list of pending `ValidatorUpdate`s that must be sent to the consumer chain once the CCV channel is established.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### State on the consumer chain
- `ConsumerPortId = "consumer"` is the port ID the consumer CCV module is expected to bind to.
- `providerClient: Identifier` identifies the client of the provider chain (on the consumer chain) that the CCV channel is build upon.
- `providerChannel: Identifier` identifies the consumer's channel end of the CCV channel.
- `channelStatus: ChannelStatus` is the status of the CCV channel.
- `pendingChanges: [ValidatorUpdate]` is a list of `ValidatorUpdate`s received, but not yet applied to the validator set. It is emptied on every `EndBlock()`. 
- `unbondingPackets: [(Packet, Time)]>` is a list of `(packet, unbondingTime)` tuples, where `packet` is a received `VSCPacket` and `unbondingTime` is the packet's unbonding time. The list is used to keep track of when unbonding operations are matured on the consumer chain. It exposes the following interface:
  ```typescript
  interface [(Packet, Time)]> {
    // add a packet with its unbonding time to the list;
    // the list is modified
    Add(packet: Packet, unbondingTime: Time)

    // return the list sorted by the unbonding time;
    // the original list is not modified
    SortedByUnbondingTime(): [(Packet, Time)]>

    // remove (packet, unbondingTime) from the list;
    // the list is modified
    Remove(packet: Packet, unbondingTime: Time)
  }
  ```
 
## Sub-protocols

> TODO: What about `EmitEvent()`? There are some events emitted throughout the code, but none of them are specified. 

To express the error conditions, the following specification of the sub-protocols uses the exception system of the host state machine, which is exposed through two functions (as defined in [ICS 24](../../core/ics-024-host-requirements)): `abortTransactionUnless` and `abortSystemUnless`.

### Initialization
[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

The *initialization* sub-protocol enables a provider chain and a consumer chain to create a CCV channel -- a unique, ordered IBC channel for exchanging packets. As a prerequisite, the initialization sub-protocol MUST create two IBC clients, one on the provider chain to the consumer chain and one on the consumer chain to the provider chain. This is necessary to verify the identity of the two chains (as long as the clients are trusted). 

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### **[CCV-PCF-INITG.1]**
```typescript
// PCF: Provider Chain Function
// implements the AppModule interface
function InitGenesis(state: ProviderGenesisState) {
  // bind to ProviderPortId port 
  err = portKeeper.BindPort(ProviderPortId)
  // check whether the capability for the port can be claimed
  abortSystemUnless(err == nil)

  foreach cs in state.clientStates {
    chainToChannel[cs.chainId] = cs.channelId
    channelToChain[cs.channelId] = cc.chainId
    channelStatus[cs.channelId] = cc.status
  }
}
```
- Initiator:
  - ABCI.
- Expected precondition: 
  - An `InitChain` message is received from the consensus engine; the `InitChain` message is sent when the provider chain is first started. 
- Expected postcondition:
  - The capability for the port `ProviderPortId` is claimed.
  - For each consumer state in the `ProviderGenesisState`, the initial state is set, i.e., the following mappings `chainToChannel`, `channelToChain`, `channelStatus` are set.
- Error condition:
  - The capability for the port `ProviderPortId` cannot be claimed.

#### **[CCV-PCF-CCPROP.1]**
```typescript
// PCF: Provider Chain Function
// implements governance proposal Handler 
function CreateConsumerChainProposal(p: CreateConsumerChainProposal) {
  if currentTimestamp() > p.spawnTime {
    // get UnbondingPeriod from provider Staking module
    unbondingTime = stakingKeeper.UnbondingTime()

    // create client state as defined in ICS 2
    clientState = ClientState{
      chainId: p.chainId,
      trustLevel: DefaultTrustLevel, // 1/3
      trustingPeriod: unbondingTime/2,
      unbondingPeriod: unbondingTime,
      latestHeight: p.initialHeight,
    }

    // create consensus state as defined in ICS 2;
    // SentinelRoot is used as a stand-in root value for 
    // the consensus state set at the upgrade height
    consensusState = ConsensusState{
      timestamp: currentTimestamp(),
      root: SentinelRoot,
      nextValidatorsHash: BlockHeader().NextValidatorsHash,
    }

    // create consumer chain client and store it
    clientId = clientKeeper.CreateClient(clientState, consensusState)
    consumerClient[p.chainId] = clientId
  }
  else {
    // store the client as a pending client
    pendingClient[(p.spawnTime, p.chainId)] = p.initialHeight
  }
}
```
- Initiator: 
  - `EndBlock()` method of Governance module.
- Expected precondition: 
  - A governance proposal with `CreateConsumerChainProposal` as content has passed (i.e., it got the necessary votes). 
- Expected postcondition: 
  - If the spawn time has already passed,
    - `UnbondingPeriod` is retrieved from the provider Staking module;
    - a client state is created;
    - a consensus state is created;
    - a client of the consumer chain is created and the client ID is added to `consumerClient`.
  - Otherwise, the client is stored in `pendingClient` as a pending client.
- Error condition:
  - None.

> **Note:** Creating a client of a remote chain requires a `ClientState` and a `ConsensusState` (as defined in [ICS 2](../../core/ics-002-client-semantics)). For Tendermint clients, creating a `ConsensusState` requires setting a validator set of the remote chain (see [ICS 7](../../client/ics-007-tendermint-client/README.md#consensus-state)). The provider chain uses the fact that the validator set of the consumer chain is the same as its own validator set. The rest of information to create a `ClientState` it receives through a governance proposal.

### Validator Set Update
[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

The *validator set update* sub-protocol enables the provider chain 
- to update the consumer chain on the voting power granted to validators on the provider chain
- and to ensure the correct completion of unbonding operations for validators that produce blocks on the consumer chain.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### **[CCV-PCF-EBLOCK.1]**
```typescript
// PCF: Provider Chain Function
// implements the AppModule interface
function EndBlock(): [ValidatorUpdate] {
  // iterate over all consumer chains registered with this provider chain
  foreach chainId in chainToClient.Keys() {
    // get list of validator updates from the provider Staking module
    valUpdates = stakingKeeper.GetValidatorUpdates(chainId)

    // add validator updates to the list of pending updates 
    pendingUpdates[chainId] = pendingUpdates[chainId].Aggregate(valUpdates)

    // TODO pendingUpdates should be a list of VSCs; 
    // once the channel is established, all the VSCs are sent, 
    // so that we can receive ACKs for the unbonding
    
    // check whether 
    //  - there are pending updates; 
    //  - and there is an established CCV channel to the consumer chain
    if len(pendingUpdates[chainId]) != 0 AND chainId IN chainToChannel.Keys() {
      // the CCV channel should be in VALIDATING state
      abortSystemUnless(channelStatus[chainId] == VALIDATING)

      channelKeeper.SendPacket(packet)
    }
  }

  // do not return anything to the consensus engine
  return []   
}
```
- Initiator: 
  - ABCI.
- Expected precondition:
  - An `EndBlock` message is received from the consensus engine. 
  - The provider Staking module has an up-to-date list of validator updates for every consumer chain registered.
- Expected postcondition:
  - For every consumer chain with `chainId`
    - A list of validator updates is retrieved from the provider Staking module and aggregated to the list of pending updates for the consumer chain with `chainId`, i.e., `pendingUpdates[chainId]`.
    - If the list of pending updates is not empty and there is a CCV channel with status `VALIDATING` for the the consumer chain with `chainId`, then
      - a `VSCPacketData` is created, with `updates = valUpdates`;
      - a packet with the created `VSCPacketData` is sent on the channel associated with the consumer chain with `chainId`.
- Error condition:
  - A CCV channel for the consumer chain with `chainId` exists and its status is not set to `VALIDATING`.

> **Note**: The expected precondition implies that the provider Staking module MUST update its view of the validator sets for each consumer chain before `EndBlock()` in the provider CCV module is invoked. A solution is for the provider Staking module to update its view during `EndBlock()` and then, the `EndBlock()` of the provider Staking module MUST be executed before the `EndBlock()` of the provider CCV module.
