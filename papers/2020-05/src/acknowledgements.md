The original idea of IBC was first outlined in the Cosmos whitepaper [@cosmos_whitepaper], and realization of the protocol is made possible in practice by the Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus & efficient light client verification of Tendermint, introduced in *Tendermint: Consensus without Mining* [@tendermint_consensus_without_mining] and updated in *The latest gossip on BFT consensus* [@tendermint_latest_gossip]. An earlier version of the IBC specification [@ethan_frey_ibc_spec] was written by Ethan Frey.

Many former & current employees of All in Bits (dba Tendermint Inc.), Agoric Systems, the Interchain Foundation, Informal Systems, and Interchain GmbH participated in brainstorming & reviews of the IBC protocol. Thanks are due in particular to Ethan Buchman, Jae Kwon, Ethan Frey, Juwoon Yun, Anca Zamfir, Zarko Milosevic, Zaki Manian, Aditya Sripal, Federico Kunze, Dean Tribble, Mark Miller, Brian Warner, Chris Hibbert, Michael FIG, Dev Ojha, Colin Axner, and Jack Zampolin.
