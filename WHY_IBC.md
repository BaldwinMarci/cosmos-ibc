## Why IBC?

The design space of "interblockchain communication protocols" is wide, and the term itself has become a bit too all-encompassing. The "Interblockchain Communication Protocol" (IBC) is a very particular point in that design space, chosen to provide specific security, composability, and modularity properties for the expected interchain ecosystem of interoperable blockchains. This document outlines the "why" of IBC and enumerates many of the primary design goals.

### Heterogeneity

### Locality

#### Locality of communication & information

#### Locality of trust & security

#### Locality of permissioning

### Modularity

### Automatability

### Efficiency
